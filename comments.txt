"To solve the anonymization problem, I created an Apache Airflow DAG that processes CSV files in chunks. I implemented the processing logic in Python using Pandas, ensuring memory efficiency by processing 100,000 rows at a time. Airflow manages the workflow, logs, and error recovery, making the solution robust and scalable. I successfully tested the setup with a small file and designed it to handle a 2 GB file efficiently, even on a standard laptop. This approach is modular, scalable, and can be extended to distributed systems if needed."
